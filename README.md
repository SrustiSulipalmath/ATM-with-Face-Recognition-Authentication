# ATM with Face Recognition Authentication

Project Overview:
This project is an ATM-like system where users must verify their identity using facial recognition before entering their PIN and proceeding with transactions. The system was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, with Flask managing the backend.

üîç Current Status & Issues:

‚úÖ Implemented Features:
User interface for ATM transactions.
Basic Flask backend for transaction handling.
Initial integration with FaceIO for facial recognition (not fully implemented).

‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Incomplete Features:
Face recognition is incomplete due to FaceIO being a paid service.
Some functionalities may not be working properly or need better error handling.
Session management and security measures might need improvements.

üí° Possible Fixes & Enhancements:
Replace FaceIO with OpenCV or DeepFace for free face recognition.
Debug transaction flow and form validation issues.
Improve error handling and user feedback messages.
Enhance UI/UX for a more interactive experience.

üìå Tech Stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Flask (Python)
Face Recognition (To be Fixed): FaceIO (Replaceable with OpenCV/DeepFace)
